# Stock price direction prediction using ANN 
This project predicts optimal buy-in or buy-out decisions for Amazon stock using an extensive historical dataset spanning from 1997 to 2020. The dataset includes daily share price information (open, close, high, low, adjusted close) and trading volumes. Post-COVID data is excluded to mitigate heightened volatility. Our approach employs a diverse ensemble of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, LSTM) to construct a predictive system based on historical share price performance.  

The results demonstrate an accuracy of about 69% with the inclusion of eight features, incorporating both original dataset features and engineered features. These features enhance the model's predictive capabilities. The anticipated outcomes include a comprehensive analysis of historical data, refined predictive models for buy-in or buy-out decisions, and insights into key factors influencing Amazon stock movements. Focusing on pre-COVID data and utilizing a diverse set of models, our research aims to provide investors with a stable and reliable tool for decision-making in the dynamic stock market environment, contributing to improved financial forecasting. 

The project has the potential for enhancement in various aspects, including optimizing features, implementing advanced time-series analysis, exploring diverse ensemble methods, integrating deep learning models and establishing continuous monitoring for adaptive updates.
